At its core are **propositions**, declarative statements that are either true or false, but not both. These can be combined using **logical operators** such as conjunction ($\\land$, AND), disjunction ($\\lor$, OR), negation ($\\neg$, NOT), and implication ($\\to$, IF...THEN). A **truth table** systematically lists all possible truth values for a compound proposition based on the truth values of its constituent simple propositions. For example, the truth table for $P \\land Q$ shows it's true only when both $P$ and $Q$ are true. Understanding these operators is vital for designing digital circuits and writing conditional statements in programming. We also delve into **conditional statements ($P \\to Q$)**, which assert that if $P$ is true, then $Q$ must be true, and their related forms: **converse ($Q \\to P$)**, **inverse ($\\neg P \\to \\neg Q$)**, and **contrapositive ($\\neg Q \\to \\neg P$)**. It's important to recognize that only the original statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, a concept frequently used in proofs. This logical foundation is the bedrock upon which all other discrete structures are built, enabling precise communication and verification of facts.\",\n          \"keyTakeaway\": \"Logical operators and truth tables are the fundamental building blocks for constructing and evaluating complex propositions, essential for formal reasoning and computation.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"pageNumber\": 2,\n          \"pageTitle\": \"Advanced Logic and Proof Techniques\",\n          \"content\": \"Building on propositional logic, we explore **laws of inference**, which are rules that allow us to derive valid conclusions from a set of premises. Examples include Modus Ponens $( (P \\land (P \\to Q)) \\to Q )$ and Modus Tollens $( (\\neg Q \\land (P \\to Q)) \\to \\neg P )$, which are indispensable for constructing formal proofs. Understanding these laws helps in systematically proving statements and verifying the correctness of algorithms. Beyond direct proof, **mathematical induction** is a powerful proof technique used to establish the truth of a statement for all natural numbers. It involves two steps: the **base case** (proving the statement for the smallest value, usually $n=0$ or $n=1$) and the **inductive step** (assuming the statement is true for some arbitrary integer $k$ and then proving it's true for $k+1$). This method is particularly useful for proving properties of recursive algorithms, summations, and sequence definitions. Another elegant proof technique is the **Pigeonhole Principle**, which states that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. This seemingly simple principle has surprisingly profound applications in various fields, from number theory to computer science (e.g., collision detection in hash tables or proving minimum number of items required to guarantee a specific outcome). Common pitfalls in these proofs often involve errors in the inductive hypothesis or misapplying the pigeonhole principle's conditions.\",\n          \"keyTakeaway\": \"Mathematical induction and the Pigeonhole Principle are powerful, distinct techniques for proving universal statements and existence, respectively, providing rigorous foundations for mathematical reasoning.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"pageNumber\": 3,\n          \"pageTitle\": \"Sets, Relations, and Cardinality\",\n          \"content\": \"The concepts of **sets**, **relations**, and **functions** are fundamental to all branches of mathematics and computer science.

We categorize types of relations based on properties like reflexivity, symmetry, antisymmetry, and transitivity. An **equivalence relation** (reflexive, symmetric, transitive) partitions a set into disjoint equivalence classes, which has applications in clustering and data organization. A **function** is a special type of relation where each element in the domain maps to exactly one element in the codomain. We distinguish between injective (one-to-one), surjective (onto), and bijective (one-to-one and onto) functions, which are critical for understanding mappings and transformations. Finally, we tackle **countable and uncountable sets**, a crucial concept in understanding the 'size' of infinite sets. A set is **countable** if its elements can be put into a one-to-one correspondence with the natural numbers (e.g., integers, rational numbers). An **uncountable set** cannot be put into such a correspondence (e.g., real numbers, power set of natural numbers).

We explore fundamental laws like commutativity, associativity, distributivity, De Morgan's laws, and identity laws, which are crucial for simplifying Boolean expressions. The concepts of **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)** and **Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)** are important for standardizing Boolean expressions. A CNF is a conjunction (AND) of clauses, where each clause is a disjunction (OR) of literals. DNF is a disjunction (OR) of terms, where each term is a conjunction (AND) of literals. These forms are essential for circuit minimization and logic synthesis. The most direct **application of Boolean algebra is to switching circuits**. Each variable can represent the state of a switch (open/closed), and operations correspond to series/parallel connections of switches. Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR) are physical implementations of Boolean functions, forming the building blocks of all digital electronic devices.

Examples include the set of integers under addition $(\\mathbb{Z}, +)$ or the set of non-zero rational numbers under multiplication $(\\mathbb{Q}^*, \\cdot)$. We explore specific examples like the **quaternion group ($Q_8$)**, a non-abelian group of order 8, which is crucial in quantum mechanics and computer graphics; the **dihedral group ($D_n$)**, which represents the symmetries of a regular $n$-gon (rotations and reflections); and **permutation groups ($S_n$)**, which consist of all possible permutations of $n$ distinct objects under composition. Understanding these concrete examples helps solidify the abstract definitions. We then move to **elementary properties of groups**, such as the uniqueness of identity and inverses, and cancellation laws. A **subgroup** is a subset of a group that is itself a group under the same operation. This concept allows us to decompose and analyze larger groups. We also introduce **cosets**, which are sets formed by multiplying all elements of a subgroup by a fixed group element.

Examples include the integers $(\\mathbb{Z}, +, \\cdot)$ and the set of all $n \\times n$ matrices. Rings provide a generalized framework for arithmetic operations beyond typical numbers. An **integral domain** is a commutative ring with a multiplicative identity and no zero divisors (meaning that if $a \\cdot b = 0$, then either $a=0$ or $b=0$). The integers $(\\mathbb{Z})$ are an integral domain, but the set of $2 \\times 2$ matrices is not. Integral domains capture properties common to integer-like number systems. Finally, a **field** is a commutative integral domain where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse. Examples include rational numbers $(\\mathbb{Q})$, real numbers $(\\mathbb{R})$, and complex numbers $(\\mathbb{C})$. Fields are crucial because they allow for 'division' (multiplication by an inverse), making them the most familiar type of number system in algebra. Finite fields (Galois fields) are particularly important in cryptography (e.g., AES, elliptic curve cryptography) and coding theory. **Lagrangeâs Theorem** states that for any finite group $G$, the order (number of elements) of any subgroup $H$ of $G$ divides the order of $G$.

The historic **KÃ¶nigsberg bridge problem**, which asked if a walk could be found that crosses each of seven bridges exactly once, famously led Euler to develop the foundational concepts of graph theory. Understanding these basic building blocks is essential before delving into more complex graph properties and algorithms, as they provide the language for precisely describing and analyzing networked structures.\",\n          \"keyTakeaway\": \"Graphs are powerful models for representing relationships; mastering basic terminology is the first step to analyzing complex networks and their properties.\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"pageNumber\": 2,\n          \"pageTitle\": \"Eulerian and Hamiltonian Paths/Circuits\",\n          \"content\": \"Building on basic graph concepts, we delve into special types of paths and circuits with significant applications. An **Eulerian line** (or Euler path) in a graph is a trail that visits every edge exactly once. An **Eulerian graph** is one that contains an Eulerian circuit (a closed Eulerian trail), meaning a trail that starts and ends at the same vertex and traverses every edge exactly once. Euler's theorem provides a simple criterion for determining if an Eulerian circuit or path exists: an undirected graph has an Eulerian circuit if and only if it is connected and every vertex has an even degree. It has an Eulerian path (but not a circuit) if it is connected and exactly two vertices have odd degrees. Graphs possessing these properties are also called **unicursal graphs**. These concepts are crucial in problems requiring exhaustive traversal, like designing efficient inspection routes for pipelines or street sweeping. In contrast, a **Hamiltonian path** is a path that visits every vertex exactly once. A **Hamiltonian circuit** is a Hamiltonian path that starts and ends at the same vertex. Unlike Eulerian paths, there is no simple necessary and sufficient condition to determine if a Hamiltonian path or circuit exists; this is a much harder problem (NP-complete). While the problem of finding them is computationally challenging, their study has led to many heuristics and approximation algorithms for various optimization tasks. These concepts are distinct and address different types of traversal requirements: Eulerian focuses on edges, Hamiltonian on vertices.\",\n          \"keyTakeaway\": \"Eulerian paths/circuits traverse every edge exactly once (solvable with degree criteria), while Hamiltonian paths/circuits visit every vertex exactly once (a significantly harder, NP-complete problem).\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"pageNumber\": 3,\n          \"pageTitle\": \"Real-World Graph Problems: TSP and Chinese Postman\",\n          \"content\": \"The theoretical concepts of Eulerian and Hamiltonian circuits find direct application in classic optimization problems with significant real-world impact. The **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)** is arguably the most famous problem in combinatorial optimization: given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city? This is a Hamiltonian circuit problem in a complete graph where edge weights represent distances. TSP is an NP-hard problem, meaning no efficient algorithm is known for finding the optimal solution for large instances. Therefore, practical solutions often involve heuristics and approximation algorithms (e.g., Nearest Neighbor, Christofides algorithm). Its applications are vast, including logistics, circuit board drilling, DNA sequencing, and vehicle routing. The **Chinese Postman Problem (CPP)**, also known as the Route Inspection Problem, is related to Eulerian circuits. It seeks the shortest route that traverses every street (edge) in a network at least once, starting and ending at the same point. If the graph is Eulerian, the solution is straightforward. If not, the problem involves adding 'dummy' edges (repeating existing edges) to make all vertex degrees even, then finding the shortest path that includes these repeated edges.

This concept is fundamental in circuit board design, map drawing, and network layout, where avoiding crossovers simplifies construction and reduces interference. If a graph can be redrawn to avoid crossings, it is planar, regardless of how it's initially depicted. For connected planar graphs, **Euler's formula** provides a powerful relationship between the number of vertices $(V)$, edges $(E)$, and faces (regions bounded by edges, including the outer region) $(F)$: $V - E + F = 2$. This formula holds for any connected planar graph and can be used to prove properties about planar graphs or even to demonstrate non-planarity indirectly. For example, it implies that $E \\le 3V - 6$ for simple planar graphs with $V \\ge 3$. The ultimate criterion for **non-planarity** is provided by **Kuratowski's Theorem**, which states that a finite graph is planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph that is a subdivision of $K_5$ (the complete graph on 5 vertices) or $K_{3,3}$ (the complete bipartite graph on 3 + 3 vertices). These two graphs, often called **Kuratowski's two graphs**, are the minimal non-planar graphs.

This acyclic property makes trees particularly important in computer science for representing hierarchical structures and efficient data organization. Every tree with $n$ vertices has exactly $n-1$ edges. Another key property is that there is a unique simple path between any two vertices in a tree. A **pendent vertex** (or leaf node) is a vertex of degree 1. In any tree with at least two vertices, there are at least two pendent vertices. This property is crucial for algorithms that traverse trees (e.g., leaf-first processing). **Rooted trees** designate one vertex as the 'root', establishing a hierarchical parent-child relationship among vertices. The depth of a node is its distance from the root, and the height of a tree is the maximum depth. **Binary trees** are a specific type of rooted tree where each node has at most two children (left and right). Binary trees are widely used in data structures (e.g., binary search trees, heaps) due to their efficient search and insertion properties.

For a weighted graph (where edges have associated costs), a **minimum spanning tree (MST)** is a spanning tree with the smallest possible total edge weight. Finding an MST is a classic problem with efficient algorithms like Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm. **Prim's algorithm** builds an MST by iteratively adding the cheapest edge that connects a vertex in the current tree to a vertex outside the tree. **Kruskal's algorithm** works by iteratively adding the cheapest edge from the entire graph that does not form a cycle with already chosen edges.

At its core are **propositions**, declarative statements that are either true or false, but not both. These can be combined using **logical operators** such as conjunction ($land$, AND), disjunction ($lor$, OR), negation ($\\neg$, NOT), and implication ($\\to$, IF...THEN). A **truth table** systematically lists all possible truth values for a compound proposition based on the truth values of its constituent simple propositions. For example, the truth table for $P land Q$ shows it\"s true only when both $P$ and $Q$ are true. Understanding these operators is vital for designing digital circuits and writing conditional statements in programming. We also delve into **conditional statements ($P \\to Q$)**, which assert that if $P$ is true, then $Q$ must be true, and their related forms: **converse ($Q \\to P$)**, **inverse ($\\neg P \\to \\neg Q$)**, and **contrapositive ($\\neg Q \\to \\neg P$)**.

Understanding these laws helps in systematically proving statements and verifying the correctness of algorithms. Beyond direct proof, **mathematical induction** is a powerful proof technique used to establish the truth of a statement for all natural numbers. It involves two steps: the **base case** (proving the statement for the smallest value, usually $n=0$ or $n=1$) and the **inductive step** (assuming the statement is true for some arbitrary integer $k$ and then proving it\"s true for $k+1$). This method is particularly useful for proving properties of recursive algorithms, summations, and sequence definitions. Another elegant proof technique is the **Pigeonhole Principle**, which states that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. This seemingly simple principle has surprisingly profound applications in various fields, from number theory to computer science (e.g., collision detection in hash tables or proving minimum number of items required to guarantee a specific outcome).

These forms are essential for circuit minimization and logic synthesis. The most direct **application of Boolean algebra is to switching circuits**.

This simple abstraction is incredibly powerful for representing networks (social, computer, transportation). We\"ll cover **basic terminology**: an edge connecting vertices $u$ and $v$ makes $u$ and $v$ adjacent. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it. A **simple graph** is one with no loops (edges connecting a vertex to itself) and no multiple edges between the same pair of vertices.

Euler\"s theorem provides a simple criterion for determining if an Eulerian circuit or path exists: an undirected graph has an Eulerian circuit if and only if it is connected and every vertex has an even degree. It has an Eulerian path (but not a circuit) if it is connected and exactly two vertices have odd degrees. Graphs possessing these properties are also called **unicursal graphs**. These concepts are crucial in problems requiring exhaustive traversal, like designing efficient inspection routes for pipelines or street sweeping.

This is a Hamiltonian circuit problem in a complete graph where edge weights represent distances. TSP is an NP-hard problem, meaning no efficient algorithm is known for finding the optimal solution for large instances. Therefore, practical solutions often involve heuristics and approximation algorithms (e.g., Nearest Neighbor, Christofides algorithm). Its applications are vast, including logistics, circuit board drilling, DNA sequencing, and vehicle routing.
