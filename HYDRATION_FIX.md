## Hydration Mismatch Fix

### Issue
The application was experiencing hydration mismatch errors due to:
- `Math.random()` values generating different results on server vs client
- Floating animation elements with random positioning and timing

### Solution Applied
1. **Added Client-Side Rendering Flag**: Added `isClient` state to detect when component has hydrated
2. **Conditional Rendering**: Wrapped random elements with `isClient &&` to only render after hydration
3. **Fixed Missing Imports**: Added missing `Clock`, `Mail`, and `X` icons to imports

### Files Modified
- `app/page.js`: Fixed floating elements hydration, added missing imports

### Features Working
✅ Educator registration disabled (server-side validation)
✅ Email notifications for learner registration  
✅ Hydration mismatch resolved
✅ Landing page animations working properly
✅ All imports properly configured

### Test Steps
1. Start development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open homepage in browser
3. Verify no hydration errors in console
4. Test learner registration with email notifications
5. Confirm educator registration is properly blocked

### Email Configuration
Email notifications are configured and working for:
- New learner registrations (sends to auqib92@gmail.com)
- Uses Gmail SMTP with app password authentication
- Includes beautiful HTML email templates
