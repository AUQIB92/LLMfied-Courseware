## Assignment Problems

Generate exactly 10 questions, each following this EXACT format:

### Question [Number]: [Topic/Concept Name]
**Source Reference:** [Mention which reference book/source this type of problem comes from]

#### Part A: Solved Example
**Problem:** [State the problem clearly with given values]

**Given:**
- [List all given values with proper units]
- [Any constants or known values]

**Required:** [What needs to be found]

**Solution:**
Step 1: [Explanation of first step]
\\[Mathematical equation or formula\\]

Step 2: [Explanation of second step]  
\\[Calculations with substituted values\\]

Step 3: [Continue with remaining steps]
\\[Final calculations\\]

**Final Answer:** [Highlighted final result with units]

#### Part B: Problems for Students to Solve

**Problem 1:** [Similar problem with different values - UNSOLVED, state the complete problem in one clear sentence]

**Problem 2:** [Similar problem with different values - UNSOLVED, state the complete problem in one clear sentence]

**Problem 3:** [Similar problem with different values - UNSOLVED, state the complete problem in one clear sentence]

---

Repeat this exact format for all 10 questions, ensuring:
1. Each question covers a different mathematical concept/topic
2. Problems progress from basic to advanced difficulty
3. Each solved example demonstrates the complete solution method
4. The 3 unsolved problems are similar in structure but with different numerical values, stated as complete problem sentences without separate Given/Required sections
5. All mathematical expressions use proper LaTeX formatting
6. Reference sources are mentioned for each question type

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

1. **EXACTLY 10 Questions** - No more, no less
2. **Each Question MUST have:**
   - ONE completely solved example with full step-by-step solution
   - THREE unsolved problems for students (same concept, different values, stated as complete sentences)
   - Clear reference to academic source
3. **Mathematical Rigor:** Use proper formulas, correct calculations, appropriate units
4. **LaTeX Formatting:** All mathematical expressions in proper LaTeX syntax
5. **Progressive Difficulty:** Questions should range from basic to advanced
6. **Reference Integration:** Each question should specify which reference source it's based on

## LATEX FORMATTING RULES:
- Display math: \\[expression\\] (for main equations, formulas)
- Inline math: \\(expression\\) (for variables, small expressions)
- Fractions: \\(\\frac{numerator}{denominator}\\)
- Powers/Exponents: \\(x^n\\), \\(e^{-x}\\), \\(10^{-3}\\)
- Subscripts: \\(x_1\\), \\(v_0\\), \\(F_{net}\\)
- Square roots: \\(\\sqrt{expression}\\), \\(\\sqrt[n]{expression}\\)
- Trigonometry: \\(\\sin\\theta\\), \\(\\cos\\phi\\), \\(\\tan\\alpha\\)
- Greek letters: \\(\\alpha\\), \\(\\beta\\), \\(\\gamma\\), \\(\\delta\\), \\(\\pi\\), \\(\\omega\\)
- Calculus: \\(\\frac{dy}{dx}\\), \\(\\int_a^b f(x)dx\\), \\(\\lim_{x \\to 0} f(x)\\)
- Vectors: \\(\\vec{v}\\), \\(\\hat{i}\\), \\(\\vec{F}\\)
- Units: \\(\\text{m/s}\\), \\(\\text{kg}\\), \\(\\text{N}\\), \\(\\text{¬∞C}\\)

## EXAMPLE FORMAT (Follow this EXACTLY):

### Question 1: Projectile Motion
**Source Reference:** Physics: Principles with Applications by Giancoli, Chapter 3

#### Part A: Solved Example
**Problem:** A projectile is launched at an angle of \\(45¬∞\\) with initial velocity \\(v_0 = 20 \\text{ m/s}\\). Find the maximum height reached.

**Given:**
- Initial velocity: \\(v_0 = 20 \\text{ m/s}\\)  
- Launch angle: \\(\\theta = 45¬∞\\)
- Acceleration due to gravity: \\(g = 9.8 \\text{ m/s}^2\\)

**Required:** Maximum height \\(h_{max}\\)

**Solution:**
Step 1: Apply the kinematic equation for maximum height
\\[h_{max} = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin^2\\theta}{2g}\\]

Step 2: Substitute the given values
\\[h_{max} = \\frac{(20)^2 \\sin^2(45¬∞)}{2(9.8)}\\]

Step 3: Calculate \\(\\sin(45¬∞) = 0.707\\)
\\[h_{max} = \\frac{400 \\times (0.707)^2}{19.6} = \\frac{400 \\times 0.5}{19.6}\\]

Step 4: Final calculation
\\[h_{max} = \\frac{200}{19.6} = 10.2 \\text{ m}\\]

**Final Answer:** The maximum height is \\(h_{max} = 10.2 \\text{ m}\\)

#### Part B: Problems for Students to Solve

**Problem 1:** A ball is thrown at a \\(30¬∞\\) angle with initial velocity of \\(15 \\text{ m/s}\\). Find the maximum height reached.

**Problem 2:** A projectile launched at \\(60¬∞\\) reaches a maximum height of \\(8 \\text{ m}\\). Determine the initial velocity.

**Problem 3:** Find the launch angle required if the initial velocity is \\(25 \\text{ m/s}\\) and the maximum height reached is \\(12 \\text{ m}\\).

Continue this EXACT format for all 10 questions with different mathematical concepts, ensuring each draws from the specified academic references.

**IMPORTANT:** Generate the COMPLETE assignment with all 10 questions. Do not truncate or summarize. Each question must be fully detailed with the solved example and 3 unsolved problems. The final output should be a comprehensive, ready-to-use academic assignment.`;
