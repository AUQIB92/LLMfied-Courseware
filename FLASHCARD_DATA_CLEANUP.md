# Flashcard Data Cleanup Instructions

## Issue Identified

Your screenshot shows "Quick Review Flashcards (1)" which indicates there's still legacy `flashCards` data in the database that's being displayed in the course viewer, even though we've updated the editor to ignore legacy data.

## Solution Options

We can update the course viewer to automatically convert or ignore legacy flashcard data, similar to what we did in the editor.

### Option 2: Database Migration (More Complete)

Run a script to clean up all legacy flashcard data in the database.
