## Sign-In Fix Summary

### 🔧 Issues Identified and Fixed

#### 1. **Missing `isAuthenticated` Property**
- **Problem**: The main page was trying to use `isAuthenticated` from `useAuth()`, but this property wasn't provided by AuthContext
- **Solution**: Added `isAuthenticated: !!user` to AuthContext provider

#### 2. **AuthForm Not Closing on Successful Login**
- **Problem**: After successful login, the modal remained open and users weren't redirected
- **Solution**: Updated AuthForm to call `onClose()` callback on successful login/registration

#### 3. **No Loading State During Authentication Check**
- **Problem**: Users might see flashing content while auth state is being determined
- **Solution**: Added loading state check with proper loading UI

### 🚀 Changes Made

#### `contexts/AuthContext.js`
```javascript
// Added isAuthenticated property to provider value
isAuthenticated: !!user
```

#### `components/AuthForm.js`
```javascript
// Added onClose prop handling
export default function AuthForm({ initialMode = "login", onClose }) {
  
  // Added success handling
  if (result.success) {
    if (onClose) {
      onClose()
    }
  }
}
```

#### `app/page.js`
```javascript
// Added loading state handling
const { user, isAuthenticated, loading } = useAuth()

// Added loading UI
if (loading) {
  return <LoadingScreen />
}

// Existing auth check now works properly
if (isAuthenticated && user) {
  return user.role === "educator" ? <EducatorDashboard /> : <LearnerDashboard />
}
```

### 🧪 How Sign-In Now Works

1. **User clicks "Sign In"** → Modal opens with AuthForm
2. **User enters credentials** → Form submits to `/api/auth`
3. **API validates credentials** → Returns JWT token and user data
4. **AuthContext updates** → Sets user state and stores token in localStorage
5. **AuthForm closes** → Modal disappears via `onClose()` callback
6. **Page re-renders** → Detects `isAuthenticated = true` and redirects to dashboard
7. **Dashboard loads** → User sees appropriate dashboard (Learner/Educator)

### 🔄 Authentication Flow

```
Landing Page → Sign In Modal → API Call → Success → Modal Closes → Dashboard
```

### ✅ Expected Behavior

- ✅ Sign-in modal opens when "Sign In" is clicked
- ✅ After successful login, modal automatically closes
- ✅ User is immediately redirected to their dashboard
- ✅ Loading state prevents content flashing
- ✅ Learner users see LearnerDashboard
- ✅ Educator users see EducatorDashboard (if any exist)
- ✅ Token and user data persist in localStorage
- ✅ Page refresh maintains login state

### 🚫 Issues Resolved

- ❌ Modal staying open after login
- ❌ No redirect to dashboard
- ❌ `isAuthenticated` undefined error
- ❌ Content flashing during auth check
- ❌ Inconsistent authentication state

The sign-in process should now work seamlessly! 🎉
